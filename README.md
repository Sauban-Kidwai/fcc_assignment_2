## Introduction

This assignment explores advanced cryptographic concepts and practical implementations, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, cryptographic hash functions, and secure key management, reinforcing theoretical knowledge through hands-on programming and protocol analysis.

---

## Assignment Overview

Assignment 2 covers the following core topics[1]:

- **Mathematical Algorithms in Cryptography:**  
  Principles behind symmetric and asymmetric encryption (RSA, Diffie-Hellman), and the role of hash functions for data integrity.

- **Block and Stream Ciphers:**  
  Operation and differences between block ciphers (AES, 3DES) and stream ciphers, with practical code examples.

- **Key Management:**  
  Secure key distribution, generation, destruction, message authentication codes (MACs), and key derivation functions.

- **Digital Signatures and Authentication:**  
  Structure and verification of digital signatures, emphasizing authenticity and non-repudiation.

- **Programming Component:**  
  Python implementations for encryption/decryption (3DES, RSA, SHA-256), digital signature creation/verification, and secure message handling.

3. **Run the Scripts:**  
- Encrypt/decrypt text files with provided Python scripts.
- Generate and verify digital signatures.
- Follow instructions in the `README.md` for each script to test cryptographic operations.

## Key Features

- **Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption:**  
Implements encryption and decryption with block ciphers (3DES, AES) and public-key cryptography (RSA).

- **Hash Functions and Message Digests:**  
Uses SHA-256 for secure message digests and integrity verification.

- **Digital Signatures:**  
Tools for signing messages and verifying signatures to ensure authenticity.

- **Key Management:**  
Demonstrates secure key generation, storage, and destruction practices.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:**  
Each function and module is documented for clarity and ease of use, following best practices for cryptographic software.
