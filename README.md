## Assignment Overview

Assignment 2 covers the following core topics[1]:

- **Mathematical Algorithms in Cryptography:**  
  Principles behind symmetric and asymmetric encryption (RSA, Diffie-Hellman), and the role of hash functions for data integrity.

- **Block and Stream Ciphers:**  
  Operation and differences between block ciphers (AES, 3DES) and stream ciphers, with practical code examples.

- **Key Management:**  
  Secure key distribution, generation, destruction, message authentication codes (MACs), and key derivation functions.

- **Digital Signatures and Authentication:**  
  Structure and verification of digital signatures, emphasizing authenticity and non-repudiation.

- **Programming Component:**  
  Python implementations for encryption/decryption (3DES, RSA, SHA-256), digital signature creation/verification, and secure message handling.
